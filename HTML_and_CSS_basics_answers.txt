** Why do we separate HTML and CSS?

    Although HTML and CSS do not need to be seperate it is best practice to do so because it is more efficient.

    It is also a benefit when there are different people working on different parts of the project -- for example, if one designer works with HTML and the other works with CSS.

** How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? i.e. how does an element get its “default” styles?
